# Introduction

<p>This file is created to test how two Computer-Aided Translation programs – Wordfast Pro 7 and Trados 2022 – read markdown files.</p>

## What is a CAT?
[Computer-Aided Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation) software (usually known as CAT) is a program that helps translators translate various files, including Markdown *.md files.

There are **many** diferent CATs. Two of them are *Wordfast Pro* and *Trados Studio*.
## Why is This Important?
Markdown files have unusual formatting. The syntax for __bold__ can be for example: `__bold__`.  
The question arises: Will a CAT know which symbol is part of Markdown syntax and which is used as part of the text?

We'll learn soon enough.

## General Information

I'll group Markdown syntax into:
1. standard text formatting;
2. links:
   1. links to sections with headers;
   2. links to files;
   3. links to images;
   4. links to websites;
3. quotations:
   1. standard quotation;
   2. inline code;
   3. block code;
4. HTML tags inside Markdown;
5. tables.
