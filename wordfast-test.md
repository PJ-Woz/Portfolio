This *is* just a **test** of how well ~~Wordfast~~ reads Markdown.  
Let's try a [link](Images/IMG_20200401_210429.jpg "Git gud").  
Let's try something else.
Like this.

# A very important header.
## Another header.
Let's type more content [link 2](https://translatorion.com).
## If that's what you wish.
Great, another sentence.
`This is a sample`

What else....

|No.| Name | Surname |
|---| ---| ---|
1 | John| Smith|
2 | Jane | Black|

- [A very important header.](#a-very-important-header)
