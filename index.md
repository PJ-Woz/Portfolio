##[My first text in Markdown](./Project-Wo≈∫nikowski-2022-11-27.md)
This is a homework I did during Technical Communication post-grad studies at Vistula University.  
I know this could be optimised significantly in terms of content.  
It's meant to be read like a book, so the progress is linear.  
This is done after 2 hours of training on Markdown.
