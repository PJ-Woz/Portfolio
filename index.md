## [My first text in Markdown](./Project-Woźnikowski-2022-11-27.md)

This is a homework I did during Technical Communication post-grad studies at Vistula University.

I know this could be optimised significantly in terms of content.

It's meant to be read like a book, so the progress is linear.

This was done after 2 hours of training on Markdown.

## [A Markdown text for testing Wordfast Pro and Trados Studio 2022](./Markdown-in-CAT-test.md)

I wrote this file to test how two Computer-Aided Translation programs – Wordfast Pro 7 and Trados 2022 – read Markdown files.

**What is a CAT?**

[Computer-Aided Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation) software (usually known as CAT) is a program that helps translators translate various files, including Markdown \*.md files.
There are **many** diferent CATs. Two of them are *Wordfast Pro* and *Trados Studio 2022*.

**Why is this important?**

Markdown files have unusual formatting. The syntax for __bold__ can be for example: `__bold__`.  
The question arises: Will a CAT know which symbol is part of Markdown syntax and which is used as part of the text?

And to make it even spicier, I also included a few HTML tags to see how they are read in combination with Markdown syntax.
