## [How do CATs process Markdown files?](https://pj-woz.github.io/cats-vs-markdown/)

This is a graduation project from my Technical Communication post-grad studies at Vistula University.

This project is a test of how three Computer-Aided Translation programs – Phrase, Wordfast Pro 7, and Trados 2022 – open and save Markdown files. As part of the comparison, a Markdown test file was prepared, in which many Markdown tags were used in combination with HTML and even an uncomplicated JavaScript.

The project was written completely in Markdown and published with Just the Docs theme.
